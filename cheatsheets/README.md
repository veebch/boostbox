# Cheat-sheets

Because keystrokes are both great, and easily forgotten. Most of the things that appear here will have customisable key mappings, but these will attempt to capture the main thrust of the default shortcuts. The inkscape **svg** versions are included for easy tweaking. 

The few applications here fit together elegantly, and create a lean TUI workflow that includes identity managment/ encryption.

## Editor: vim/ neovim

The sheet contains at least 3 ways to [exit vim](https://thenewstack.io/how-do-you-exit-vim-a-newbie-question-turned-tech-meme/), so it must be good.

Something that it doesn't yet convey is the distinct modes (Edit, Command, Visual).

This is a simplified version of the one at [flatcap.org](https://flatcap.org/vim/)

## Mail: neomutt

This is a simplification. A more comprehensive list can be found via the help command (?).

To get encryption/ indentity management working with gpg and neomutt, do [this](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/15-pgp/).

## Terminal multiplexer: tmux

These keystrokes are using the config at https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config.
