# Boostbox

Some notes on a command-line terminal, built fron a super 8 viewer.

# Background

The Boostbox was originally a little project to turn an old Super 8 viewer into a YouTube viewing terminal. After some time tweaking it, it turned into a terminal that used tmux, neomutt, weechat and gcalcli to spend as much time in a fast/responsive terminal as possible.

# Parts
- Raspberry Pi 4 (any sbc linux machine with HDMI out should work
- Hanimex E300 super 8 viewer
- Ortholinear 40% keyboard
- AC to 5V DC power supply (to attach to switch)
- 7inch 4:3 LED screen (like [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004454598585.html))
- Step-up convertor to convert 5V to the 9V DC needed by the screen

# Assembly

# Setup

The screen will be slightly obscured by the edges of the frame. This can be fixed by adding overscan values to `/boot/config.txt`.

# Software

In no particular order

## tmux

## neomutt

## gcalcli

## weechat
