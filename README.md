# Boostbox

Some notes on a command-line terminal built fron a super 8 viewer.

# Background

The Boostbox was originally a little project to turn an old Super 8 viewer into a YouTube viewing terminal. After some time tweaking it, it turned into a terminal that used tmux, neomutt, weechat and gcalcli to spend as much time in a fast/responsive terminal as possible.
